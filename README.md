1. **ChatGPT-4** generated foundational ViewModel and Room DB code, optimized complex Compose layouts, and solved state management challenges
2. **GitHub Copilot** accelerated boilerplate code creation with 85% acceptance rate for DAOs, repositories, and composable structures
3. **DeepSeek** refactored navigation graphs and fixed 20+ Jetpack Compose warnings.

Total AI interactions: 127 prompts with 3.2 average iterations per solution
